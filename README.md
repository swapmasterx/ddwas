# Darkest Dungeon: Weapons, Armor and Skills

This is an early prototype of the mod, only including the following:  
-Crusader Swords level 1 through 5 (does not have crafting recipe yet)  
-Stunning Blow level 1 through 5 on the swords. Custom sound added but not functioning due to knowlage gap with Spell Engine sound implementation.   
  -Successful cast animation used from "Better Combat" also not functioning due to knowlage gap with Spell Engine animation implementation.  
-Battle Heal level 3. Custom sound not implemented until stunning blows sound effect can be resolved. (does not have crafting recipe yet)  
-Added new "Citrine" gem  
-Comes in:   
  -Block of Citrine (crafted with 9 citrine or can be crafted into 9 citrine)  
  -Citrine Ore (drops 1 raw Citrine)   
  -Deepslate Citrine Ore (drops 1-2 raw Citrine)   
  -Raw Citrine (can be turned into Citrine via a stonecutter)  
  -Does not generate naturaly or appear in loot tables yet.  

-Crusader armor assets are drawn up but not yet implemented into the game.
